Comedy Society at the University of York provides a platform for all people to do all types of comedy.
We host shows every week of term, all completely written and performed by our members. As well as this we run weekly workshops on <span class="red">Stand Up, Writing and Improv.</span> All of our workshops give you the chance to try out your ideas or get inspiration from others in a <span class="red">pressure free</span> environment.

We also go to the Edinburgh Fringe every year in the form of two shows; our sketch show, [Present & Correct](http://www.nouse.co.uk/2015/08/15/edinburgh-fringe-2015-review-present-and-correct/) and our Improv show, [The Shambles]({{site.shambles_website}}).
