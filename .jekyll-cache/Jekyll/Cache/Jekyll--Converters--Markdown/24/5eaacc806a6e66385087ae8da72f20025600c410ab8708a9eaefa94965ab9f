I",<p>Comedy Society at the University of York provides a platform for all people to
do all types of comedy.
We host shows every week of term, all completely written and performed by our
members. As well as this we run weekly workshops on <span class="red">Stand Up,
Sketch Writing, Sketch Acting and Improv.</span> All of our workshops give you
the chance to try out your ideas or get inspiration from others in a <span class="red">pressure free</span> environment.</p>

<p>We also go to the Edinburgh Fringe every year in the form of two troupes; our
sketch troupe, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45sgFnbzS2c">The Dead
Ducks</a>
and our Improv troupe, <a href="http://comedysoc.github.io/shambles-website">The Shambles</a>.</p>
